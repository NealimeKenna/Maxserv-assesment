# MaxServ B.V. Assignment

This project acts as a foundational implementation for the MaxServ B.V. assignment. You are welcome to modify, expand, and refactor the code as needed to meet the assignment criteria. Please note that while PHP packages are allowed, the use of PHP frameworks is not permitted.

## Getting Started
To execute the project, you will need to install the following prerequisites:

- `Docker` - A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. [Learn more](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- `Git` - A distributed version control system. (Only required if your code is managed in a Git repository) [Learn more](https://git-scm.com/).

Now that all prerequisites are installed, we can initiate the project by following the steps below:

1. Execute the `docker-compose up -d` command to launch the application.
2. Execute the `docker exec app php bin/console migrate` command to set up the database schema.

The project should now be operational and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
You can also access phpMyAdmin at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Console Commands
The project includes a console application for performing CLI tasks. Since PHP is running inside Docker, you should execute these commands using `docker exec`.

- `docker exec app php bin/console migrate [database]` - Runs database migrations. If no database is specified, it uses the default one from environment variables.

### Running Tests
To run the automated tests, use the following command:
`docker exec app php vendor/bin/phpunit`

### Application flow
The application begins from a single entry point, `public/index.php`, which ensures composer autoloading and initiates a bootstrap process.
The bootstrap process sets up the application. It creates a `Container` to facilitate dependency injection and a `Router` to manage incoming requests.

A default route is specified in `config/routes.yaml`, which links the `/` route to the `IndexController` and the `index` method.
The `IndexController` renders the `index.html.twig` template, located in the `templates` directory.
It utilizes the `Connection` service to interact with the database and uses `Filterable` and `Sortable` traits for data manipulation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

### Git
This project employs Git for version control, and basic Git configuration is included.

- `.gitignore` - Lists files and directories that should be ignored by Git. [Learn more](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

### Docker
The project can be run within a Docker container, with the necessary Docker configuration provided.

- `Dockerfile` - Contains instructions for building the Docker image. [Learn more](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
- `docker-compose.yml` - Defines the services, networks, and volumes for running the Docker container. [Learn more](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
- `.dockerignore` - Lists files and directories to be ignored by Docker. [Learn more](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file).

### Composer
This project utilizes Composer for dependency management, with the relevant configuration included.

- `composer.json` - The file used to manage and install project dependencies. [Learn more](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md).

### Configuration
The project includes configuration files for various tools and services.

- `config/routes.yaml` - Contains the routing configuration for the project. [Learn more](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#creating-routes-in-yaml-xml-or-php-files).

### Packages
The `packages` directory contains the code for the project.

- `packages/core` - Contains the core functionality of the application.
- `packages/app` - The package where the assignment requirements can be implemented.

### Public
The `public` directory contains the entry point for the application. It is advisable to keep this directory as clean as possible and not alter the logic in the `index.php` file.

### Templates
The `templates` directory contains the Twig templates for the application.

- `templates/index.html.twig` - The main product listing template.
- `templates/product/detail.html.twig` - The product detail modal template.

## Core Package
The `core` package encompasses the core functionality of the application. The `core` offers some default functionality that can be utilized while constructing your implementation.

### Database Connection and Migrations
The `core` package provides a database connection using PDO. The database connection is configured through environment variables, which can be set in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
Migrations are managed through the `MigrateService` and can be executed via the console command.

### Template Rendering
The `core` package includes a `TemplateRenderer` class that can be used to render Twig templates. The `TemplateRenderer` class is initialized with the `Twig` environment and can be employed to render templates. All templates should be defined in the `templates` directory.

## Provided PHP packages
With the foundation, we provide you with several PHP packages out-of-the-box. These packages are included in the `composer.json` file and can be utilized to enhance the functionality of the project.
